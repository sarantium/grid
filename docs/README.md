**Grid** is an opinionated framework that uses **X, Y** coordinates to help product managers identify their current location in the product development process.

It is designed to increase individual certainty and improve group collaboration by providing a precise, shared language for speaking about the end-to-end product development lifecycle.

Grid's key features are:

- **Simple**: The entire product development process is displayed on a single page
- **Consistent**: Standardised vocabulary for describing different stages and activities
- **Intuitive**: Cell coordinates make navigation and referencing a breeze
- **Curated**: Modern product tools selected with a bias for lean workflows
- **Extensible**: Add, remove or modify rows, columns and cells to get the right fit

## :material-map-marker-plus-outline: Positioning

**Grid** simplifies how product managers can create convincing, high level explanations of what they are doing now and what they might do next as part of product development.

Sometimes, positioning is carried out to an audience of one. Grid reduces uncertainty and increases confidence for the stories product managers tell themselves about the sequence and value of current and future activity.

As a communication tool, Grid also helps product managers share these stories with other internal teams and decision makers, again derisking the unknown...

It can also help chart routes across a life

It combines SQLAlchemy and Pydantic and tries to simplify the code you write as much as possible, allowing you to reduce the **code duplication to a minimum**, but while getting the **best developer experience** possible.

**SQLModel** is, in fact, a thin layer on top of **Pydantic** and **SQLAlchemy**, carefully designed to be compatible with both.
