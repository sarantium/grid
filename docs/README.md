**Grid** is an opinionated framework that uses **X, Y** coordinates to help locate and connect activities in the product development process.

It is designed to increase individual certainty and improve group collaboration by providing a precise, shared language for speaking about the end-to-end product development lifecycle.

Grid's key features are:

- **Simple**: The entire product development process is displayed on a single page
- **Consistent**: Standardised vocabulary for describing different stages and activities
- **Intuitive**: Cell coordinates make navigation and referencing a breeze
- **Curated**: Modern product tools selected with a bias for lean workflows
- **Extensible**: Add, remove or modify rows, columns and cells to get the right fit

## :material-map-marker-plus-outline: Positioning

Positioning increases confidence in the stories that product managers tell themselves and others about the sequence and value of product activity. It is useful to individuals and teams for:

- [x] locating current activity
- [x] tracing past routes and planning future routes
- [x] sharing journeys

!!! tip

    **Positioning** helps create **convincing** and **connected** explanations about **digital product development practice**
