**Grid** is an opinionated framework that uses **X, Y** coordinates to help product managers identify their current location in the product development process.

It is designed to increase individual certainty and improve group collaboration by providing a precise, shared language for speaking about the end-to-end product development lifecycle.

Grid's key features are:

- **Simple**: The entire product development process is displayed on a single page
- **Consistent**: Standardised vocabulary for describing different stages and activities
- **Intuitive**: Cell coordinates make navigation and referencing a breeze
- **Curated**: Modern product tools selected with a bias for lean workflows
- **Extensible**: Add, remove or modify rows, columns and cells to get the right fit

## :material-map-marker-plus-outline: Positioning

**Grid** reduces uncertainty and increases confidence for the stories product managers tell themselves and others about the sequence and value of current and future activity.

!!! tip

    **Grid** helps product managers create convincing, high level explanations about product development practice

At minimum, the framework lets individuals sidestep impostor syndrome

As a communication tool, Grid also helps product managers share these stories with other internal teams and decision makers, again derisking the unknown...

It can also help chart routes across a life

## Example

Let's use **customer interviews** as a very common product activity to orientate users

### Moving down columns

An interview is an activity that is part of the **Discover (H2)** phase in the **Growth (H1)** stage of the product development cycle. A milestone output of this activity is an **Opportunity Solution Tree (H4)**

|       |             H             |
| :---: | :-----------------------: |
| **1** |        **Growth**         |
| **2** |         Discover          |
| **3** |    :material-magnify:     |
| **4** | Opportunity Solution Tree |

### Moving across rows

The **Growth (H1:I1)** stage of this activity continues to the next phase - **Define (I2)** - in which the milestone output is a **Product Brief (I4)**

|       |             H             |              I              |             L             |
| :---: | :-----------------------: | :-------------------------: | :-----------------------: |
| **1** |        **Growth**         |         **Growth**          |       **Maturity**        |
| **2** |         Discover          |           Define            |         Research          |
| **3** |    :material-magnify:     | :font-awesome-solid-shapes: | :fontawesome-solid-flask: |
| **4** | Opportunity Solution Tree |        Product Brief        |        Experiments        |

### Moving orthogonally

Regular interaction and mini-interviews with customers can also be part of ongoing **Experiments (L4)** in the **Research (L2)** phase of the **Maturity (L1)** stage.

|       |             H             |             L             |
| :---: | :-----------------------: | :-----------------------: |
| **1** |        **Growth**         |       **Maturity**        |
| **2** |         Discover          |         Research          |
| **3** |    :material-magnify:     | :fontawesome-solid-flask: |
| **4** | Opportunity Solution Tree |        Experiments        |
