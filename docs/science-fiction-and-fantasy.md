# Science Fiction and Fantasy Reading List

Congratulations! You've found an :material-egg-easter: easter egg :material-egg-easter: on the site that is hidden from the main navigation tree. This is a list of fiction books I'm reading in 2023 in the following genres:

- :alien: science fiction
- :crossed_swords: fantasy
- :video_game: litrpg

I hope you find some of these as interesting as I do. My rating scale goes from 1 to 5 stars. Anything rated :star::star::star: or above is usually worth reading at least once. DNF stands for Did Not Finish and means I couldn't make it through till the end of the book because I found it too boring.
