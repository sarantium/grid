I learned that there are at least 3 types of requirement documentation:

- Market Requirements Documentation (MRD)
- Product Requirements Documentation (MRD)
- Software Requirements Documentation (MRD)

I also learned about [Atlassian's One Page PRD](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/product-management/requirements)

# Product Strategy

# notes

1.

In general, product strategy PM questions test your knowledge and comfortability with:

Competitive Analysis

Market Analysis

Product Roadmaps

Business Strategy

# Three types of questions

## Question 1

- define a company strategy => most impt is you have a perspective and have evidence
  - suggestion to watch the keynote of the CEO.
  - my note is that I could use Brandon's

## Question 2

- second type of question is how to expand a market.
  - Take an existing product and improve it

## Question 3

- third type of question is to have a sexy technology. How to build a business around this technology.
  - More about going about and finding different customer segments.

One thing that can be helpful is a simple cost-benefit analysis
don't overuse a framework. actually think about the problem.
How might you use your insights from users.

The attached article in url link is a good one with three tiers of product strategy

- Tier 1 : Environment => Market Analysis, Tradeoffs, Risk Mitigation, Market trends, barriers to entry, state of the market, Customer Segments, Total Addressable Market, Trends.
- Tier 2 : Situation => ROI , Positioning, Competitive Analysis, Business Strategy, Prioritisation, Tradeoffs, Barriers to entry
- Tier 3 : Opportunity [My terminology] => Platform strategy, Roadmapping, Prioritisation, Tradeoffs, Risk Mitigation
  - Weigh each of these based on a chosen matrix (like risks, opex, capex, market trends, alignment with mission, sustainability etc) and prioritize them
  - go-to market strategy

=>Tier 4????

- maybe align with the business vision? or should this be in tier 2

There is a slight difference between product design and product strategy. In the first case maybe focus on UI/UX in the latter case talk about market and competitive analysis.

A product improvement framework might be in 4 steps:

- Step 1 : What does success look like?
- Step 2 : Segment Users, Identify pain points etc.
- Step 3 : Brainstorming how we get to this outcome
- Step 4 : What problem do we prioritize solving? <!--* interesting and impt -->

=> Why you didn't choose some paths
=> Where do I talk about user segmentation
=> go-to-market now or later
=> where is the scenario taking place
=> barriers to entry
=> Is it consistent with the platform approach? <!-- I think this should be in tier 3 as the right alignment. -->
